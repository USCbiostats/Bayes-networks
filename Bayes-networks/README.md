# Bayes-networks

Program for MCMC fitting of Bayesian networks, including source & sink constraints and external network info.  

The source code is in main.cpp (which requires header files random4f.h and cholesky21.h).

Input data are P3 simulation 8.dat and P3 simulation 8.dag.txt, which is the simulated data used to create the example in the grant proposal (generated by P3 simulation v8.cpp).

project 2.gephi illustrates a sample fitted DAG, with the edge colors indicating whether they are in the simulated model or not, the edge thickness proportional to the log posterior probability, and the node colors indicating the type of node (exposure, gene, metabolite, microbial species, disease).  Inputs to the GEPHI program are network-nodes.xlsx and network-edges.xlsx created from the outputs of the C++ program.

iterations - null start.xlsx is an example of convergence plots created from the iterations.txt output file from the C++ program, illustrating the likelihoods, priors, numbers of nodes, agreement with the prior topology, acceptance rates, etc.
